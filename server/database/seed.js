Yes, he may not be the intended first boss but he can be if you proceed that way, couple that with the fact that he teaches you basic mechanics of bloodborne such as parry's, the rally system, boss phases and so much more he is the type of boss that requires you to learn how to play the game as intended and he is amazing at it. His lore is immaculate, his phase transitions show off the effects the blood has on the Yharnhamites and the hunters of the church. He also has a slue of NPC's around his arena that are tied to his lore including his wife (that he killed in a bloody rage) and his daughter that supplies the player with the Music Box that is used to subdue Gascoigne when he is in beast phase by playing his favorite song. The only gripes I have about this boss is the tombstones in his arena that you cannot destroy, leading to many deaths caused by getting cornered against one. Overall Gascoigne is a boss that gets me excited to replay BloodBorne everytime.",

Not to mention this scream is the same one you hear while climbing the ladder right outside of Iosefka's Clinic at the very start of the game. This boss does a good job of getting you ready to fight the hideous beasts BloodBorne provides so plentily. Cleric Beasts lore is pretty straight forward he is a Cleric that went blood crazy turning him into this beast, however; he becomes indirect foreshadowing of one the most important characters in the game so that's pretty cool. Gameplay wise this boss is super simple, just repeat a cycle of hitting and circling the beast, serrated damage gives a huge beast. Because of the cleric beasts size however, he has the old FromSoftware special of getting staggered every time he takes a step back. His run back allows for easy refilling of blood-vials and quicksilver bullets to keep you stocked up. If you need an extra edge just shoot him in the head twice when first entering the arena, this allows you to repost him for good damage.",

That's really all there is good to say about this boss. Their lore is disappointing as taking one look at their appearance, and their grab attack, tells you their purpose. They are super easy compared to everything else you've fought at this point, the only points they get for difficulty is from the Mad Ones they spawn if you at least one Insight and the grab attacks they can use to dig out your eyes if your not paying attention. They are really boring and the run back doesn't add to the fun in any way. However; the only annoyance they have is they are teleport spammers and even then they teleport in a select few locations making it easy to find them again. Also, once you kill one of the witches the other can respawn the dead witch if you don't kill them both quick enough, although; you will almost always kill the last witch quick enough this doesn't happen. They are also the most common boss turned enemy which docs appearance for uniqueness purposes. Just a poor quality boss all around.",

The leader of the Executioners tasked with killing all of the Vilebloods of Cainhurst Castle. The martyrs first phase is all about magic, he can summon a slashing wave of skeleton heads that you must dodge through, an AOE that can either be immediate or delayed by his second swing, and even a spinning saw of bloody heads with low tracking. Getting him to second phase sees Logarius use his scythe and off-hand sword a lot more, allowing for parry and backstab opportunities, he can shove his sword into the ground creating an seemingly endless barrage of swords flying at your character. This sword summons length, mixed with the slanted roof messing with AI is the only two annoyances about this fight. Once defeated Logarius will drop his Crown of Illusions, dawning it and walking to his chair will reveal what he was hiding, a tower housing the last of the Vilebloods, the immortal Queen Annalise. It's not known whether Logarius was trying to keep her hidden to trap her, allowing for time to present a way to end her life, or if he was protecting the thing he swore so solemnly to destroy. It is all left up to speculation although as we find through Alfred's questline it wouldn't have done much good to kill her as she can be resurrected from the Altar of Despair.",

He started the healing church and used blood ministration research to fuel his take of the best way to achieve human ascension into Great Ones (and 'may' have poisoned the citizens of Old Yharnam in the process). He is even seen in cutscenes (namely the one where he betrays Willem after beating Vicar Amelia) and spoken about in multiple item descriptions and dialogue. He is so important to the story, making it all the more disappointing that his boss fight is so terrible. He looks exactly like the Cleric Beast (which is lore accurate) with a molten lava core, a curse laid upon him curtesy of Kos. His move set in the first phase is also the exact same, albeit fire AOE's following most moves and a few unique attacks, which is fine but why does every attack seem to one shot a character with an almost egregious levels of HP, and the best fire resistant gear in the game. He is the definition of difficulty done wrong. In second phase he does become unique by falling and breaking his legs off, spewing lava from his molten core while crawling on the ground. This is cool, but then the rest of the fight becomes a battle of sticking to his sides, too far behind him results in getting staggered by his lava pour, and being in front of him results in long swipes, moving combos, and a lava spew that will most likely make you overcorrect your dodge, and either get hit or end up behind him in his lava. The best way to describe Laurence is... great character, terrible boss.",

Eventually, he will gain AOE's at the end of his arms during attacks requiring more precise timing to punish him. In third phase he will gain even more range by ripping off two of his arms, and while this would make fighting him head on a lot more challenging, you can stand in front of his groin triggering his jump attack, which can be easily dodged allowing for punishment on his head with minimal worries. This boss fight is most likely very easy at this point in the game, however; just as a note, the version in the Defiled Chalice is the sole reason I never want to go through the dungeons again.",

The Wet Nurse has multiple arms used for attacks that vary from outward slashes, to jump attacks, to multi hit combos, the fight feels almost like a horrific dance of some kind. Eventually it will release an AOE that if connects, will start a mini phase of clone summoning attacks from Mergo's Wet Nurse. This attack can actually be dodged with precise timing, rendering the phase useless. The main complaints of this fight, is how anti-climatic it can be, being very easy for it's place in the game, however; it can still pose a challenge if your timing isn't correct, Also, this technically can be the final boss of the game and it just doesn't feel like a rewarding boss in that regard, making the game bittersweet if you choose this ending.

His boss fight is not as interesting, first phase he will run around a mini-level requiring you to chase him to move him to the next point, eventually, and I mean eventually; he will run into the first boss area where he is joined by two marionettes, he will spam the Augur of Ebrietas move, which can easily be dodged resulting in major punishment if your stamina/positioning allows for it. After reaching half health he will disappear and start saying how, a hunter is a hunter, even in a dream. Which leads to an even longer chase scene, that will finally result in a one-on-one fight. It is best to stick close to Micolash as at medium or long range he will spam A Call Beyond, which can decimate your health.

Orphan is probably the most aggressive boss in Bloodborne, not giving you a second to breathe for a lot of the fight, this is combatted by the fact if you can dodge through his hits you have plenty of time to heal, punish, or even go for a backstab opportunity, he is screaming in agony as the fight continues. Eventually he will enter second phase gaining a lighting summon, and holding his placenta weapon more as a axe then a sweeping flail.

This is good lore so why is their score so low? Well a lot of this lore is represented more by the area they reside in not the Shadows themselves (hence the high level score), the chalices obviously have some connection with the woods, and the area leading up to them makes it more interesting that they were able to use the snake parasite in they way they did. They are a decently fun fight and the difficult completely banks on your ability to parry and crowd control. There's nothing particularly obnoxious about this fight, it just doesn't do anything special. On top of that, they become basic enemies much later in the game which docs points because they aren't really unique.",
